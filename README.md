# 👋 Hi, I'm Daniyar

🎓 Computer Science | 💻 Web Developer | ⚙️ Backend | Design

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate 14 y.o learner and builder with a strong background in robotics, software development, and team collaboration.
🤖 I’ve spent 3 years in FIRST LEGO League (FLL), where I explored mechanical design, autonomous programming, and creative problem-solving.
🛠 I'm currently in my first year of FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC), diving deep into advanced robotics, Java-based control systems, and autonomous path planning.
💻 Beyond robotics, I’m developing skills in web development, working with both front-end (React, TypeScript) and back-end (Node.js, PostgreSQL) technologies to build full-stack applications.
🤝 I thrive in team environments, whether it’s pairing up for debugging autonomous code or collaborating on multi-member software projects. I believe in clear communication, shared learning, and building solutions together.
⚡ I’m always curious, always building — and excited for every new challenge that pushes my limits.
