## üöÄ About Me

I have been programming since I was ten. Since childhood, I loved to disassemble various electronics. Then, in the 5th grade, I
joined the robotics club at school, where I get basic knowledge and experience in robotics. 
In the winter of 2022, I took part in the FIRST competition for the first time, where 
I got my first experience working in a team. I have a positive attitude towards teamwork, I am open and honest with my teammates. I strive for new knowledge and develop with each new experience.

In addition to robotics and programming, I am about mountaineering.
I like to overcome fear and strive for the heights and grandeur of the mountains. In mountains come true human essense, and only you can do - trust your teammate
